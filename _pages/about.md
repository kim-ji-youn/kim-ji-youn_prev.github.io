Hi! I am Jiyoun(김지연)!

I am studying in the German Language and Literature Department at Sungkyunkwan University in South Korea, advised by Professor Munpyo Hong.
I am interested in computational semantics and pragmatics. Now I focus on studying linguistic expressions that have implicitly and explicitly different meanings. My master degree's thesis is about detecting metaphorical expressions using machine learning with linguistic features.  
I am travel lover, cinephile, and yogini

  - Applied segmentation strategies for simultaneous interpretation system for English and Korean
  - Designed and developed an algorithm to implement ideal segmentation strategy to detect optimal segmentation units
  - was applied as part of [Genie talk], the official translation app for the [2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics].

    + 2016: A linguistic study on translation for simultaneous interpretation system
      + surveyed simultaneous interpretation strategies done by human interpreter
      + proposed heuristic rules to segmentation and did experiment
      + source/target language: Korean and English
    + 2017: A study on correlation between segmentation unit of simultaneous interpretation and translation rate
      + analyzed optimal segment length on the basis of the number of tokens
      + suggested 6 linguistic features to segmentation
      + source/target language: Korean and English
    + 2018: A study on segmentation unit of simultaneous interpretation considering language-dependent features
      + analyzed optimal segment length based on time
      + proposed rhetorical structure marker as feature for segmentation
      + source/target language: Korean, English and Chinese
    + 2019: A study on cognitive-pragmatic model of simultaneous interpretation
      + viewed simultaneous interpretation as discourse
      + suggested 3 methods to segmentation
      + implemented algorithms for each method
    + 2020: Optimizing Segmentation Method for Simultaneous Interpretation
